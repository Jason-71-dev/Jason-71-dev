# Hi, I'm Jason!

I'm a passionate **web developer** with a focus on creating clean, functional, and user-friendly applications. I enjoy building personnal projects, and constantly learning new technologies.

## About Me
-  I love working with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, and I'm exploring modern frameworks like **React**.
-  Always eager to learn and grow, whether it's new tools, libraries, or coding best practices.
-  Outside of coding, I'm passionate about football and enjoy balancing tech with sports.
-  I'm currently working on personal projects to sharpen my skills.

## Fun Fact
-  Football addict — if I'm not coding, I'm probably chasing a ball.
